What's more, as it is the top-one in the park, we have heart-shaped cycling routes and bicycles made for two and three, and during your ride on the bike, you will be mesmerized by the mirror-like lake reflecting the pure sky, the peacock spreading its tail and countless birds singing on the trees with luxuriant foliage, and you will just get a general panoramic view of the park. If you get tired,you can go to the Sky wheel in the center of the park and take photos of the starry backdrop in the cockpit .At the end of the day, visitors can enjoy gorgeous fireworks with beautiful music which is a true feast for both eyes and ears.

## Day 5 - the conclusion of my trip in China!

It had already been a packed and thrilling trip, but we were not done yet! Soon we arrived at Love Park, and we were greatly welcomed by a bunch of pink balloons (which almost covered the entire sky), and I took pics of the outside of this park. You know, the air is clear there, and as it was said on its website, the peach flowers were just there! When I got closer to it, you guess what - they were real flowers, not those made of coloured paper - it's more than magical!

When I finally reached the gate, I realized that I could have been treated when I was reading its intro on the website - the scenery there is much more magnificent than that described in the intro. I was, literally, rooted to the ground. There was a bigggggggg lake and there was even an island amid the lake. Birds were everywhere.

After getting in, I found that the editor of the intro was totally a liar. He didn't even tell us the wooden bridge romantically standing over the lake and some entertainment facilities suitable for couples. Like my girlfriend and me, we played the merry-go-round - a little bit childish but interesting, and the exciting sky-wheel. We held our hands tightly and shouted with delight. 

In the afternoon, we rode a bicycle under the warm sunshine, enjoying the beauty of nature. It was just beyond my description, and I highly recommend you visit here with your gf/bf to have a first-person trip. We boated at last and landed on the island, where we found several shells on the beach. They shone in the sunbath, and, as I could see, the flaming sky, the pink trees and the glistening lake formed a picturesque view of nature, reminding me of the poem A Painting by GaoShi:
From distance, mountain is richly colorful. At close-up, flowing water does not make a sound. Spring is gone, but flowers are still around. People come near but birds do not seem frightened.

And her eyes glittered too. We just nestled together and waited until the sun eventually went down, when the different-colored and elaborate fireworks flew into the curtain of night, which created a sweet atmosphere.

It was a meaningful day. And simply visit there! It won't let you down!
